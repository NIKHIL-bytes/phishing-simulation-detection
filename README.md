# Phishing Attack Simulation and Detection

## About

This project is an educational simulation designed to demonstrate how phishing attacks work and how basic detection mechanisms can identify suspicious emails.

The project focuses on awareness and detection rather than real-world exploitation.

## Objective

- Simulate phishing email samples
- Analyze email content for phishing indicators
- Build simple rule-based detection logic
- Understand common phishing techniques

## Tools Used

- Python
- Regular Expressions
- Text-based email samples

## Rules

- No real emails are sent
- Simulation is performed using local files only
- Detection is rule-based
- Project is for learning purposes only

## Usage

- Run phishing simulation:  python simulator.py
- Run phishing detection:  python detector.py
